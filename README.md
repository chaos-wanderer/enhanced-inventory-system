A simple project created for the application of concepts and knowledge I've learned from completing University of Helsinki's Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Java Programming I & II.

• An enhanced version of [No Database Inventory Management](https://github.com/chaos-wanderer/no-database-inventory-system)

• Simple inventory management system with basic features

• No database implemented

• Pure CLI-based application (No GUI)

• Built with Maven 3.9.9

• Developed for learning purposes only — not intended for real-world use

Note: The application does not fully handle all invalid or unexpected user inputs. Input validation is limited and assumes correct usage.
